# Always commit and push after making changes

When you finish making code changes (fixes, features, or refactors):

1. **Stage and commit** before ending the conversation. Use the project's git (e.g. from the repo root: `git add` for the relevant paths, then `git commit -m "Clear message"`).
2. **Commit message**: Use a short, descriptive message (e.g. "Add mobile nav and empty states", "Fix map error boundary").
3. **Scope**: Stage only files you changed or that are part of the same logical change. Do not commit unrelated or generated files (e.g. `.temp/`, `node_modules`) unless the user asks.
4. **Shell**: Use the shell appropriate for the OS (e.g. on Windows PowerShell use `;` instead of `&&` to chain commands).
5. **Push** after committing: run `git push origin main` (or the project's default branch) so deployments run and we keep moving. If push fails (e.g. auth or network), tell the user and leave the commit local.

After committing and pushing, briefly confirm (e.g. "Committed and pushed; deployment should run.").
